# Sugars in McDonalds Menu Items

With this Kaggle's dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts

I've analyzed the amount of sugar in each item of the menu. Everything could be checked in the IPython Notebook.

Since I've used the library Plotly for plotting the data and it needs to render every time, you could check the ipython notebook locally running it or online in the following link: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pacocp/Sugars-in-McDonalds-Menu/blob/master/sugarsinMcdonalds.ipynb
